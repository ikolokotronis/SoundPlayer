# Sound Player
This is a sound player app made with tkinter with basic functions
# Setup
1. Inside the main directory (next to main.py) create a folder named "media"  
2. Move to new location (cd media/))
3. Create a new folder named "audio", where you will store your songs.  
4. In short words, the app reads mp3 files from the directory media/audio/.  
  
After this set up you can add songs from inside the app's menu, or move them directly to new created location.
