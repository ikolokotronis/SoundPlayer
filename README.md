# Sound Player

A simple sound player made with tkinter and pygame.

# Setup

1. Clone the repo
2. Install pip packages
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Inside the cloned repo directory use these commands: 
```
mkdir media
```
```
cd ./media/
```
```
mkdir audio
```
  
Now app reads mp3 files from the relative directory ./media/audio/.  
  
After this set up you can add songs from inside the app's menu, or move them directly to new created location.
