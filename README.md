# Sound Player
This is a basic sound player app made with python and tkinter.
# Setup
Inside the main directory (next to main.py) create a folder called "media", then inside it create another folder called
"audio", where you can store your music. In short words, the app reads music from the directory media/audio/.
You can also open your music from inside the application in the menu.
